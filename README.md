# resume site
This website is basically my interactive resume project which has two distinct purposes:
1. to help me overcome my fear of front-end development & kick me out of the "I am a QA engineer, not a developer" comfort zone;
2. to display my skills and to make me stand out for potential employers.

The ultimate goal is to make this website look good enough for me to feel comfortable posting its link on my LinkedIn profile page.

What I am expecting of this website:
- to be responsive (using media queries);
- to have a mobile menu (created with JS);
- to have some simple CSS animations.
