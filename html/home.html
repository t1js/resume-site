                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>First things first - <br>
                    I am not on Instagram or Twitter or TikTok, so you won't be able to snoop around them to learn what I eat and how many pictures of my cat I have (which is a lot), but! For those who finds the lack of social presence concerning and terribly wants to find out what a person I am before moving any further, I can offer something <u>much better</u>:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>- some of the Spotify playlists I have created</li>
                    <li>- Duolingo friendship</li>
                    <li>- my MBTI (I think I saw several companies asking that in their application forms, so - go for it)</li>
                    </ul>
    
                <p>and a couple of cute and random tests results because â€” well, I just happen to like what they say about me:</p> 
                <p>Also, I spend most of my free time reading, knitting and crocheting (yep, those are two different things), so here goes a list of books I would recommend to anyone who would listen:</p>

                    <h3>Now, let's get serious</h3>
                    <h5>Who am I?</h5>
                    <p>I am a QA Engineer based in Cracow. I have over 3 years of expertise in manual testing, and I'm pretty sure I am good at it. Feel free to check Resume page for all the sweet details.</p>
                    <h5>Is being a good QA Engineer enough for me?</h5>
                    <p>Nope! Which is why I dedicate a lot of my free time to honing my programming skills, particularly in JavaScript and Python.<br>
                        Why work on programming skills? That's pretty easy: I would really love to venture into Automation QA field in some near future. Definitely ask me about it during the interview!</p>
                        <h5>Is there anything else I am interested in, that's not automation?</h5>
                <p>Yes! I am very much intrigued by the field of Cybersecurity, so feel free to hit me up in case you need a Junior Security Engineer in your team.</p>
